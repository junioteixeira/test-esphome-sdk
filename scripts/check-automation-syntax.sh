# check-automation-syntax.sh — enforce the explicit-list-syntax invariant for automations.
#
# Package merging (esphome/config_helpers.py) happens on RAW YAML, before ESPHome's schema
# normalizes a single-automation mapping into a list. So two modules that each write an
# automation trigger (on_boot, on_connect, ...) in the *mapping* form:
#
#     on_boot:
#       priority: 600
#       then: [...]
#
# merge as DICTS: `priority` is overwritten by the last module and only the nested `then:`
# lists concatenate, silently collapsing two automations into one at the wrong priority.
# The *sequence* form is required:
#
#     on_boot:
#       - priority: 600
#         then: [...]
#
# This check fails when ANY `on_*` key in modules/ or hardware/ uses the mapping form. It is
# deliberately not a fixed allow-list of trigger names: every automation-shaped `on_*` key is
# subject to the same silent-collapse failure, so every one is checked. `sdk_boot:` is checked too:
# it is an automation list under another name, and every module that runs something at boot writes
# it.
#
# It also fails when a module or board writes `on_boot` at all. The list form only protects the
# SDK's modules from EACH OTHER. The device's own config is merged over them last, and
# `merge_config` (ESPHome 2026.9.1, config_helpers.py) returns the newer value outright when the two
# sides are not both lists, so a config that writes `esphome: on_boot:` as a mapping replaces every
# module's boot automations. That shipped once: devices booted without announcing their firmware
# version and without the OTA rollback watchdog. The SDK's boot actions belong under `sdk_boot:`,
# which no device config writes.
#
# Usage:
#   check-automation-syntax.sh [ROOT]   # scan ROOT/modules and ROOT/hardware (default: repo root)
#   check-automation-syntax.sh --self-test
