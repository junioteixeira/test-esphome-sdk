# check-sdk-ref.sh — enforce the ${sdk_ref} threading invariant.
#
# ESPHome treats `packages:` and `external_components:` as INDEPENDENT git sources: a module
# fetched at `@<ref>` does NOT pass that ref to an `external_components:` block inside it. The SDK
# closes this by threading the ref through ESPHome's per-file `vars:` — the consumer passes
# `vars: {sdk_ref: <ref>}` once and every module writes `ref: ${sdk_ref}`. Left implicit, the
# component source would follow the default branch while the YAML is pinned. This check guards
# both halves of that contract:
#
#   A. Validate-config consistency — in every tests/validate/*.yaml, each `vars.sdk_ref` value
#      must equal the package `ref:` value. (Both are the CI placeholder before materialization
#      and both are the same revision after; the check holds either way.)
#   B. Module ref hygiene — no file under modules/ or hardware/ may hard-code an
#      external_components ref. The only `ref:` such a file may contain is `${sdk_ref}`.
#
# Usage:
#   check-sdk-ref.sh [ROOT]      # check ROOT/tests/validate and ROOT/{modules,hardware}
#   check-sdk-ref.sh --self-test
